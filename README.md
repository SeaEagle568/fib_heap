# fib_heap
Golang fibonacci heap + Dijkstra SSSP algorithm implementation

## Summary
Here is the implmentation for [Fibonacci Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) on Go.

Also there is Dijkstra implementation on [Red-Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), but the red-black tree set isn't mine

## Testing
There are unit tests for fib heap included, A large test for Dijkstra and I also submitted SSSP solutions based on this algo to [CF](https://codeforces.com/contest/20/submission/125209707)
